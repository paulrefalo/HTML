   <strong>Note on July 27</strong><br>
   I am having such a great day. The sun was out and
   I went sailing.

   <strong>Note on August 3</strong><br>
   Was thinking about all the places I would like
   to go today. Like:
   <ul>
      <li>Florida Keys</li>
      <li>Grand Canyon</li>
      <li>Yellowstone National Park</li>
   </ul>
   I would be so excited to go to any of these places.
