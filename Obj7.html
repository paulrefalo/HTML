    <h1>I Hear America Singing by Walt Whitman</h1>
    <p>
      	I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,<br>
	Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,<br>
	The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,<br>
	The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,<br>
	The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,<br>
	The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,<br>
	The wood-cutterÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs song, the ploughboyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
    </p>
    <p id="pullquote">	
	<em>The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,</em>
    </p>
    <p>	
	The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,<br>
	Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,<br>
	The day what belongs to the day ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,<br>
	Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.
