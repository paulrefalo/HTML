    <h1>Scientists at Large Hadron Collider hope to make contact with PARALLEL UNIVERSE in days</h1>
    <h2><time datetime="2011-09-09">Friday, March 20, 2015</time></h2>
    <p>
      The staggeringly complex LHC 'atom smasher' at the CERN centre in Geneva, Switzerland, will be fired up to its highest energy levels ever in a bid to detect - or even create - miniature black holes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If successful a completely new universe will be revealed - rewriting not only the physics books but the philosophy books too.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     It is even possible that gravity from our own universe may 'leak' into this parallel universe, scientists at the LHC say.
    </p>
    
    <div id="pullquote">"We predict that gravity can leak into other dimensions"</div>
    
    <p>
     The experiment is sure to inflame alarmist critics of the LHC, many of whom initially warned the high energy particle collider would spell the end of our universe with the creation a black hole of its own.
    </p>
    
     <p>
     But so far Geneva remains intact and comfortably outside the event horizon.
    </p>
    
     <p>
     Indeed the LHC has been spectacularly successful. First scientists proved the existence of the elusive Higgs boson 'God particle' - a key building block of the universe - and it is seemingly well on the way to nailing 'dark matter'- a previously undetectable theoretical possibility that is now thought to make up the majority of matter in the universe.
    </p>
    
     <p>
     But next week's experiment is considered to be a game changer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Mir Faizal, one of the three-strong team of physicists behind the experiment, said: "Just as many parallel sheets of paper, which are two dimensional objects [breadth and length] can exist in a third dimension [height], parallel universes can also exist in higher dimensions".
    </p>
    
     <p>
     "We predict that gravity can leak into extra dimensions, and if it does, then miniature black holes can be produced at the LHC".
    </p>
    
     <p>
     "Normally, when people think of the multiverse, they think of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, where every possibility is actualised".
    </p>
    
     <p>
     "This cannot be tested and so it is philosophy and not science".
    </p>
    
     <p>
     "This  is not what we mean by parallel universes. What we mean is real universes in extra dimensions".
