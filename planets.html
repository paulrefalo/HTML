  <h3>The Planets of Our Solar System</h3>
  <p>
     Planets are both large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium<br>
     and have cleared their neighborhoods of similar objects. <br>
     There are four terrestrial planets and four gas giants in the Solar System. <br>
     The latter combined comprise more than 99 percent of<br>
     the mass in the Solar System excluding that of the Sun.
  </p>
  <p>
     I chose to put the planets into a rows so that I could provide a few stats on each planet by column.
  </p>
  <p>
     I picked the image just to make the table more engaging (wiki used the pics as th by contrast). <br>
     Each stat gets a separate cell for readability.  Just a few stats were used to keep the table from getting busy.<br>
     I also kept the even-row formatting to make the rows stand out.  I chose to center the table to balance<br>
     the amount of space on the page.  I chose white text for contrast against the black starfield <br>
     (just because the starfield is cool for a "Planets" table)
