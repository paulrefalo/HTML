      I went hiking today with my best friend Marianne in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Mountains_(California)"
      >Sierra Madre Mountains</a>.  It was a <em>gorgeous</em>
      day.  I thought of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir">John Muir</a>
      and this quote as I was hiking:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Keep close to Nature's heart... and break <em>clear</em>
        away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods.
        Wash your <em>spirit</em> clean.
